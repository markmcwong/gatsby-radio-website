We are RALLY, the 16th Cabinet of People's Campus Radio, HKUSTSU. There are two themes for our cabinet.

The first theme is innovation. We would like to introduce new programs, i.e. live show. They aim at relaxing our members and developing the creativity of our members.

The second theme is return. We would like to return to the golden age of the PCR years ago. As we all know, students in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology have created the first platform for online radio broadcasting since 1997. In this year, we will try our best to maintain a high quality of our program and make improvement in order to provide excellent shows to our members, students in UST and even people in Hong Kong.

To conclude, in this year, we will try our best to produce a great variety of programs in order to entertain both the audience and ourselves. As we are Rally, we will join hands and support each other to contribute as much as we can to members of PCR.

Our cabinet is form by 12 compositions including President, (Internal and External) Vice-presidents, Financial Secretary, (Internal and External)Secretaries, Production, Programme & Promotion Directors, Marketing & Technical Officers and Team Manager.
