We are Rapture, the 17th Cabinet of the People's Campus Radio, HKUSTSU, Session 2013-2014. We enjoy broadcasting and we just love expressing ourselves through People's Campus Radio. Our name" Rapture" carries the meaning of intense delight and the expression of great enthusiasm. It is our goal to bring happiness to the members of PCR such that the audience can feel our passion towards broadcasting.

By letting our members participate in broadcasting and many other radio-related productions such as radio drama, we hope that they can enjoy the delight and the sense of achievement brought by radio broadcasting. Above all, we want them to have fun and love radio broadcasting as much as we do. We also wish to become a major communication channel among HKUST students, in which we can represent their views. By doing so, the students' voices can be heard. We will never forget the simple fact that no broadcasting channel can succeed without quality programs. So this year, we will continue to do our best to produce good programs which provide entertainment and up-to-date information to our audience.

Our cabinet consists of 22 compositions, including the President, the Internal and the External Vice-presidents, the Financial Secretary, the Internal and the External Secretaries and some other technicians
